# Weather


My weather forecast application has search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. 



* Used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

* Used AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

* My app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* Displays the following under current weather conditions:

  * City

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity

  * Wind speed

  * UV index

* Includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name performs a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city. 

* Includes a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast displays the following:

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity
